    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Instant Dosa Batter:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a blender, add all the batter ingredients. Blend into a smooth batter. The consistency should be pourable
            but not too runny. If you are using coarse sooji then dry grind it to make it fine before using it in the
            batter.</li>
        <li>Mix in your eno or baking soda and your batter is ready! No fermentation or resting is needed.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Pyaaz Kachori Style Filling:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Coarsely grind your cumin seeds, fennel seeds and coriander seeds.</li>
        <li>In a pan, heat oil and add your freshly ground masala and hing. Roast for a minute.</li>
        <li>Then, add in your onions, ginger and green chilies, and saute for 5-6 minutes until translucent. Then, add
            in bhujiya and all the spices. Saute for a minute and add in your potatoes. Roast on medium heat for 5-6
            minutes until everything comes together. Now adjust the salt according to your taste.</li>
        <li>Finish with lemon juice and cilantro. Stir well to combine and your pyaaz ki kachori filling is ready.

    </ol>
    <h3>Dosa:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the dosa, heat a tawa or griddle for a minute. Sprinkle a few drops of water and wipe the pan with a
            cloth. Then, pour the batter with a ladle and spread it into mini rounds by making circular motions. Instead
            of a ladle, you can also use the bottom of a steel bowl.</li>
        <li>Drizzle some ghee or oil around the edges of the dosa and allow it to cook on medium heat for a few minutes
            until crispy and golden brown.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of garlic chutney on top, then spoon on some of the prepared masala. Press gently and
            continue cooking until the base is fully crisped up.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with some extra masala, rajasthani garlic chutney, and coconut chana chutney on the side.</li>
    </ol>
